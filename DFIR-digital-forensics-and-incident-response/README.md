# Blue - DFIR: Digital Forensics and Incident Response

DFIR: Digital Forensics and Incident Response is a hugely important important sector of cyber security, where your everyday security analysis is take to the next level. While most security analysts will work out of a SIEM or SOAR platform, Incident Responders and Forensic analysts typically work directly with a potentially compromised device. With this, they are required to not only be familiar with a larger array of tools for analysis, but also a much stricter set of process and procedures as their actions are often subject to legal requirements.

## **Malware Analysis**

In incident response, phishing, or security monitoring scenarios, you will encounter potentially malicious files that will require in depth analysis to certify the nature of the file. These files can be as overt as an executable labeled "virus.exe" or as covert as "resume.doc". There will be instances where even after all of your analysis, you still cannot verify the nature of the document, and therefore should be considered malicious until proven otherwise.

Outside of sandboxing, there are a host of other tools available that can perform different types of analysis on malware. There are even a few virtual machine distributions that are dedicated to malware analysis. The foremost of them are Flare-VM and Remnux. These will usually include sandboxing tools like cuckoo, code analysis tools like Snyk and Ghidra, and a host of other handy options.&#x20;
