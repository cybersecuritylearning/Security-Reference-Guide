# Scanning Utilities

## **Visual scanning with Screenshots**

The content on your target pages can provide a wealth of information as well as screenshots of those pages are part of good documentation. There are some tools that can  help with that.

<details>

<summary>Screenshot tools</summary>

* [gowitness](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness) - A website screenshot utility written in Golang, that uses Chrome Headless to generate screenshots of web interfaces using the command line, with a handy report viewer to process results.
* [eyeballer](https://github.com/bishopfox/eyeballer) - Eyeballer is meant for large-scope network penetration tests where you need to find "interesting" targets from a huge set of web-based hosts. Go ahead and use your favorite screenshotting tool like normal (EyeWitness or GoWitness) and then run them through Eyeballer to tell you what's likely to contain vulnerabilities, and what isn't.
* [EyeWitness](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness) - EyeWitness is designed to take screenshots of websites, provide some server header info, and identify default credentials if possible.
