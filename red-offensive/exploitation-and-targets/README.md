# Exploitation and Targets

## Exploit Research

After your all your active and passive scanning is finished, you should have a a pretty good understanding of the technology that makes up your target. The next step is to look for weaknesses in those technologies. Vulnerability databases are a trove of information on what versions of different technologies have vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Some vulnerability entries will even have information on and links to, the exploit coded for the target vulnerability.

<summary>Exploit Evaluation</summary>

*   [https://attackerkb.com](https://attackerkb.com) - When a new vulnerability prompts discussion on Twitter or hits media outlets, it can be difficult for security teams to wade through all the hype to determine risk and priority. How pervasive is the vulnerability? Is the expected shelf life long enough that it’s worth developing an exploit for? Is it worth dropping everything to patch or mitigate? Does an adversary or threat actor have a desire or motive to exploit the opportunity? Or is it actually… not useful or interesting?

    Security researchers and hackers are almost always the first to shed light on the specific conditions and characteristics that make a vulnerability not just exploitable, but actually useful to attackers. AttackerKB was built to capture, highlight, and expand that knowledge for the whole security community.

## Exploit Payloads

An Exploit Payload is a piece of code or a sequence of commands which is used to exploit a vulnerability or weakness in a system or software. It is usually delivered by an Exploit, which is a program or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability in a system or software. The payload is the part of the exploit which is responsible for performing the malicious action once the vulnerability has been exploited.

The payload can vary depending on the type of exploit, but it generally involves executing code or commands on the system. It can be used to install malware, gain access to a system, or even delete data and files. In some cases, the payload can be used to alter the system’s configuration or settings.

The payload can be written in any language and is typically tailored to the specific exploit and system being attacked. This ensures that the payload will be successful in exploiting the vulnerability. It is important to note that the payload is only one part of the exploit and must be used in conjunction with other components such as the exploit code or shellcode in order to be successful.

### Exploit Obfuscation

Exploit Obfuscation is a method of making malicious software or code harder to detect and analyze. This technique can be used to evade antivirus software and make it more difficult to identify and remove malicious code. There are various methods used to obfuscate code, such as changing the code structure, using alternate coding languages, and using encryption.
