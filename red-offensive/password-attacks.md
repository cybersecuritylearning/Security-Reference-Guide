{% tab title="JohnTheRipper" %}
### JohnTheRipper

[John The Ripper](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/john-ripper/) - The John The Ripper module is used to identify weak passwords that have been acquired as hashed files (loot) or raw LANMAN/NTLM hashes (hashdump). The goal of this module is to find trivial passwords in a short amount of time. To crack complex passwords or use large wordlists, John the Ripper should be used outside of Metasploit.
