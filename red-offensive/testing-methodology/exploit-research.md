# Exploit Research

## Exploit Research

After your all your active and passive scanning is finished, you should have a a pretty good understanding of the technology that makes up your target. The next step is to look for weaknesses in those technologies. Vulnerability databases are a trove of information on what versions of different technologies have vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Some vulnerability entries will even have information on and links to, the exploit coded for the target vulnerability.

<summary>Exploit Evaluation</summary>

*   [https://attackerkb.com](https://attackerkb.com) - When a new vulnerability prompts discussion on Twitter or hits media outlets, it can be difficult for security teams to wade through all the hype to determine risk and priority. How pervasive is the vulnerability? Is the expected shelf life long enough that it’s worth developing an exploit for? Is it worth dropping everything to patch or mitigate? Does an adversary or threat actor have a desire or motive to exploit the opportunity? Or is it actually… not useful or interesting?

    Security researchers and hackers are almost always the first to shed light on the specific conditions and characteristics that make a vulnerability not just exploitable, but actually useful to attackers. AttackerKB was built to capture, highlight, and expand that knowledge for the whole security community.
