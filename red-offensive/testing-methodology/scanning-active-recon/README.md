## Host Discovery

* [https://www.secjuice.com/osint-detecting-enumerating-firewalls-gateways/](https://www.secjuice.com/osint-detecting-enumerating-firewalls-gateways/)

### Tools

* [fierce](https://www.kali.org/tools/fierce/) - Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous IP space and hostnames against specified domains. Itâ€™s really meant as a pre-cursor to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all of those require that you already know what IP space you are looking for.
* [hosthunter](https://www.kali.org/tools/hosthunter/) - This package contains a tool to efficiently discover and extract hostnames providing a large set of target IP addresses. HostHunter utilises simple OSINT techniques to map IP addresses with virtual hostnames.

### Host Command

Name Servers

```
$ host -t ns domain.com
```

Email Server

```
$ host -t mx domain.com
```

### Via ICMP

```
#ping -c 1 199.66.11.4    #1 echo request to a host
#fping -sagq 192.168.0.0/24 #Send echo requests to ranges
#nmap -PEPM -sP -n 199.66.11.0/24 #Send echo, timestamp requests and subnet mask requests
```

* s = print status after completion&#x20;
* a - show active/alive targets&#x20;
* g = generate target list&#x20;
* q = dont show per target list (we dont care about unreachables)&#x20;

### Via ARP

[arp-scan](https://www.kali.org/tools/arp-scan/) - sends arp requests to look for link layer devices&#x20;

```
#sudo arp-scan -l
#nmap -sn <Network> #ARP Requests (Discover IPs)
#netdiscover -r <Network> #ARP requests (Discover IPs)
```

### NBT Discovery

```
nbtscan -r 192.168.0.1/24 #Search in Domain
```

### [Bettercap2](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap)

```
net.probe on/off #Activate all service discover and ARP
net.probe.mdns #Search local mDNS services (Discover local)
net.probe.nbns #Ask for NetBios name (Discover local)
net.probe.upnp # Search services (Discover local)
net.probe.wsd # Search Web Services Discovery (Discover local)
net.probe.throttle 10 #10ms between requests sent (Discover local)
```

### **Wake On Lan**

Wake On Lan is used to turn on computers through a network message. The magic packet used to turn on the computer is only a packet where a MAC Dst is provided and then it is repeated 16 times inside the same paket. Then this kind of packets are usually sent in an ethernet 0x0842 or in a UDP packet to port 9. If no \[MAC] is provided, the packet is sent to broadcast ethernet (and the broadcast MAC will be the one being repeated).

```
#WOL (without MAC is used ff:...:ff)
wol.eth [MAC] #Send a WOL as a raw ethernet packet of type 0x0847
wol.udp [MAC] #Send a WOL as an IPv4 broadcast packet to UDP port 9
## Bettercap2 can also be used for this purpose
```

## **Port-Scanning**

* **Open** port: _SYN --> SYN/ACK --> RST_
* **Closed** port: _SYN --> RST/ACK_
* **Filtered** port: _SYN --> \[NO RESPONSE]_
* **Filtered** port: _SYN --> ICMP message_
