# Asset and Vulnerability Management.

## Asset Management

### Sources of Asset Data

* ARP Cache - Contains IP and MAC addresses
* DHCP logs - IP addresses and Hostnames
* NMAP Scans - IP Addresses, Open Ports, Running Services, Possibly operating system
* Powershell commands - Just about everything
* SNMP - Many things
* Vulnerability Management Software
* Windows Management Interface
* EDR/IR Tools (Velociraptor)

### Manangement Tools

* [http://netdisco.org/](http://netdisco.org/) - Netdisco is a web-based network management tool suitable for small to very large networks. IP and MAC address data is collected into a PostgreSQL database using SNMP, CLI, or device APIs.
* [https://www.rumble.run/product/overview/](https://www.rumble.run/product/overview/) - Simple, fast, and accurate asset inventory tracking utility.

### MAC Address Lookup

* [MAC Vendor Lookup](https://www.macvendorlookup.com/) - Look up the vendor for a specific MAC Address
* [macvendors.com](https://macvendors.com/) - Find MAC Address Vendors. Now.
* [macaddress.io](https://macaddress.io/) - MAC address vendor lookup
* [maclookup.app](https://maclookup.app/) - Find the vendor name of a device by entering an OUI or a MAC address
