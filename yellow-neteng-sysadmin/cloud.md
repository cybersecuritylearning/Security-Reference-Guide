### Multi-Cloud Tools

* Enumeration and Auditing
  * [cloud-enum](https://www.kali.org/tools/cloud-enum/) - enumerates public resources matching user requested keywords in public clouds
  * [ScoutSuite](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite) - Scout Suite is an open source multi-cloud security-auditing tool, which enables security posture assessment of cloud environments. Using the APIs exposed by cloud providers, Scout Suite gathers configuration data for manual inspection and highlights risk areas. Rather than going through dozens of pages on the web consoles, Scout Suite presents a clear view of the attack surface automatically.
    * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8CQhvQAu7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8CQhvQAu7E)
  * [SkyArk](https://github.com/cyberark/SkyArk) - SkyArk helps to discover, assess and secure the most privileged entities in Azure and AWS
  * [PMapper](https://github.com/nccgroup/PMapper) - Principal Mapper (PMapper) is a script and library for identifying risks in the configuration of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for an AWS account or an AWS organization. It models the different IAM Users and Roles in an account as a directed graph, which enables checks for privilege escalation and for alternate paths an attacker could take to gain access to a resource or action in AWS.
  * [gitoops](https://github.com/ovotech/gitoops) - GitOops is a tool to help attackers and defenders identify lateral movement and privilege escalation paths in GitHub organizations by abusing CI/CD pipelines and GitHub access controls.
  * [cloudbrute](https://www.kali.org/tools/cloudbrute/) - This package contains a tool to find a company (target) infrastructure, files, and apps on the top cloud providers
    * [https://0xsha.io/posts/introducing-cloudbrute-wild-hunt-on-the-clouds](https://0xsha.io/posts/introducing-cloudbrute-wild-hunt-on-the-clouds)
* Offensive Frameworks
  * [ cloudsploit](https://github.com/aquasecurity/cloudsploit) - CloudSploit by Aqua is an open-source project designed to allow detection of security risks in cloud infrastructure accounts, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and GitHub. These scripts are designed to return a series of potential misconfigurations and security risks.
  * [serverless-prey](https://github.com/pumasecurity/serverless-prey) - Serverless Prey is a collection of serverless functions (FaaS), that, once launched to a cloud environment and invoked, establish a TCP reverse shell, enabling the user to introspect the underlying container:
    * [Panther](https://github.com/pumasecurity/serverless-prey/blob/main/panther): AWS Lambda written in Node.js
    * [Cougar](https://github.com/pumasecurity/serverless-prey/blob/main/cougar): Azure Function written in C#
    * [Cheetah](https://github.com/pumasecurity/serverless-prey/blob/main/cheetah): Google Cloud Function written in Go

### AWS Services and their Attack Surfaces

| AWS Service            | Attack Surface                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2                    | EC2 does in fact have a public attack surface similar to traditional physical infrastructure. Vulnerabilities that affect the OS will manifest exactly as they would on their hardware based counterpart. Things start to differ when you deal with anything that interacts with the local network or system. A vulnerability allowing command execution may allow an attacker to move laterally if configured with STS. Access tokens may also be stolen with SSRF vulnerabilities by reaching out to metadata IP addresses. More information: [EC2 Pentesting in Depth](https://www.virtuesecurity.com/aws-penetration-testing-part-2-s3-iam-ec2/) |
| S3                     | S3 requires careful consideration for bucket-level and object-level permissions. The S3 bucket itself can grant permissions to â€˜Everyoneâ€™ or â€˜Authenticated Usersâ€™. The â€˜Authenticated Usersâ€™ permissions will grant access to _all AWS users_. Because of this a pentester must check both anonymous permissions as well as semi-public permissions with their own access tokens. More information: [S3 Pentesting in Depth](https://www.virtuesecurity.com/aws-penetration-testing-part-1-s3-buckets/)                                                                                                                                             |
| ELB/ALB                | Did you know an ELB can introduce HTTP Request Smuggling? This commonly overlooked configuration can allow attackers to inject requests into other userâ€™s sessions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| SNS/SQS                | Misconfigured topics or queues can allow unauthorized users to subscribe to topics or push messages to queues. Testing of this can be done with the AWS CLI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| RDS/Aurora/Redshift    | Databases on AWS are relatively straightforward, although a penetration test should check for databases configured with public access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| EBS                    | EBS volumes can be made publicly available. The AWS CLI can be used to verify if EBS snapshots are publicly accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Cognito Authentication | An AWS pentest should determine if the Cognito configuration is appropriate for intended application behavior. This includes checking for self-signups, and enabling advanced security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
