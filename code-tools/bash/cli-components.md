# CLI Components

## Common Operators

• `&&` (logical AND) - where the command after this operator will only execute if the first command has executed successfully\
• `||` (logical OR) - where the command after this operator will only execute if the first has failed\
• `;` (semi-colon) - where the command after this operator will execute regardless of whether the first has executed successfully or not\
• `|` (pipe) - where the command before this operator is the input for the subsequent command after the operator\
• `&` (ampersand) - sends the current command to the background\
• `>, <, >>>` (redirection) - directs the output of a command or group of commands commonly for files or streams

## Stream redirection

• stdin – Standard input (the data going into the program)\
• stdout – Standard output (the data coming out of the program)\
• stderr – Standard error (any error messages generated when running the program)
