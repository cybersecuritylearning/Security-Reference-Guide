# Yellow - Code and CLI

You do not need to know how to code to be good at security. So many of those new to the industry are daunted at the prospect of learning how to code and it prevents them from taking the plunge into cyber. Does it help? Absolutely! But it is not necessary. There is a level of basic coding knowledge that is totally acceptable.

Think of it like learning the basics of a foreign language. Does everyone need 4-5 years to become completely fluent in Spanish before ordering food at your favorite taco joint? No! But understanding some of the more common terms and how to recognize the language when its used, goes a long way.\
The same is for code.

To help with this basic understanding, there have been many platforms, tools, and projects created around making understanding code, easier. As a security analyst, most are not expected to be able to write Javascript or in-depth powershell commands. But should you be able to recognize them and and be able to understand a bit of their function? Absolutely! And there are tools that can make that easier.
