# The Awesome Lists

The Awesome Lists are multiple collections various folks have made that try to condense some of the best resources for various cyber topics, all onto one list. These are great for finding out new tools to add to your arsenal, or techniques to add to your repertoire. You can use [awesome ¬∑ GitHub Topics ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/topics/awesome) and [Awesome Indexed - Searchable Awesome Lists](https://awesome-indexed.mathew-davies.co.uk) to search for what ever content you want that might  be found in the awesome lists. \
For those who love the command line, [https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh) is amazing for doing something similar, right in your bash shell.
