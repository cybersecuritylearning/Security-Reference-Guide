# OSCP

The OSCP has become the big cert goal for all aspiring hackers. Beyond being filled with content, it is a practical exam, which means no multiple choice. You will be dropped into a network where you have to compromise 5 boxes, one of which will require a buffer overflow attack to compromise. The big kicker is that you cannot use any auto exploitation tools, and you can only use Metasploit once.&#x20;

## **Official Documentation** &#x20;

As always, read the documentation. There are tons of helpful hints and suggestions in the official docs. It also clearly defines the rules of engagement for the exam. Do not use a tool that will invalidate your exam. They give you everything you need in the official course material, use it and stay within bounds.

## **Essential Videos and Courses**&#x20;

There are plenty of write ups and training classes out there for the OSCP but there are a few that are 100% gold. First off, Tiberius is a pentester of the highest caliber who has written probably the greatest course for Privilege Escalation available. I like paying for very few things, but his classes are one of them. The other big one to know is the Cyber Mentor. Heath Adams produces amazing learning content, in a way that is just super easy to digest. Not only does his Buffer Overflow class make sense of the subject better than anything else, but he has a whole collection of offensive based training and even a certification. (Its much cheaper than the OSCP). Do your self a favor and get every piece of content these two make.

## **Practice Box List**&#x20;

These are boxes that are similar to those that you will find on the exam. They will be focusing around certain tasks like buffer overflow, or exploiting a certain service. Beware that some of them are retired HTB boxes that will require a subscription to get access to.
