## Domains

Domains, more than almost any other target, have one of the largest assortments of associated data points. The most important that we will look for out of this section is the Registration data, the hosting data, site information, archived data, and analytics.

**Domain.html**

Domain.html is a tool that allows us to research multiple data points associated with a domain that might be handy during an investigation.

* Registration Data - This tool will check the domain for whois based registration data against multiple sources to get the most up to date data.
* Hosting Data - This is the information that shows which provider is physically hosting the domain. Be sure to look for indicators if the target domain is hosted by a hosting provider, or self hosted by your target.
* Exposed Data - Any information that may be exposed to the public. (Other sources are better)
* Archive Data  - When researching a domain, sometimes you can find older cached or saved versions of the website that may yield valuable information. These include Google Cache, Archive.is, and the WayBack Machine.
* Analytics data - This is a grab bag of handy searches, ranging from general site details and analytics, to similar sites on the web, or checks for backlinks to from other sites.
* Threat Data - Discussed under the Blue - Threat Data section
* Shortened URL metadata.

### **Domain Toolboxes**

These next few tools are collections of utilities focused around domains. Some can be used for research on other network artifacts like IP addresses and email records, but DNS records and domain related metadata is really where they shine.

* [ViewDNS](https://viewdns.info) - Huge toolbox with various utilities for enumerating information about a domain.
* [DNSDumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com) - Free domain research tool that can discover hosts related to a domain.&#x20;
* [MXToolbox ](https://mxtoolbox.com)-  Checks MX information for the given domain
* [W3DT](https://w3dt.net) - W3dt.Net is an online network troubleshooting site dedicated to providing relevant real-time data regarding networks, websites and other technical resources.
* [DNSLytics](https://dnslytics.com) - Find out everything about a domain name, IP address or provider. Discover relations between them and see historical data. Use it for your digital investigation, fraud prevention or brand protection.
* [HostSpider](https://github.com/h3x0crypt/HostSpider) - Command line tool that gathers tons of information about a domain including DNS records, subdomains, WHOIS, Cloudflare IP, and more!

### **Whois Vs. RDAP**

Whois is a great tool for gathering registration data for IP addresses and domains. The only problem with it is that there is not a clearly defined structure to organize registration data points and keep them maintained. Enter RDAP. A new Standard as of 2019, RDAP lookups will quickly replace WHOIS lookups.&#x20;

* RDAP lookup tool - [https://client.rdap.org](https://client.rdap.org)
* General information on RDAP - [https://www.icann.org/rdap](https://www.icann.org/rdap)

### **Sub-domains**

There are tons of highly effective tools for subdomain enumeration and brute forcing, but they can be quite noisy. During the Passive Recon phase of a penetration test, we can start with any subdomains recorded by other sources to plan out our attack/test.

* [https://omnisint.io/](https://omnisint.io) - Project Crobat: Rapid7's DNS Database easily searchable via a lightening fast API, with domains available in milliseconds.
* [Spyse Sub-domain finder](https://spyse.com/tools/subdomain-finder)
* [Pentest Tool's Sub-domain Finder](https://pentest-tools.com/information-gathering/find-subdomains-of-domain)
* [censys-subdomain-finder](https://github.com/christophetd/censys-subdomain-finder) - This is a tool to enumerate subdomains using the Certificate Transparency logs stored by [Censys](https://censys.io).

* [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) - Sublist3r is a python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT. It helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains for the domain they are targeting. Sublist3r enumerates subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates subdomains using Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS.
  * [https://tryhackme.com/room/rpsublist3r](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpsublist3r)
* [puredns](https://github.com/d3mondev/puredns) - Puredns is a fast domain resolver and subdomain bruteforcing tool that can accurately filter out wildcard subdomains and DNS poisoned entries.

### **Domain Certificates**

Domain Certificates are an interesting and useful item to research when mapping out a target domain. Beyond the various attacks that can be performed by exploiting these certificates, looking up the domain certificates can lead to discovery of hosts, sub-domains, and related targets that were previously undiscovered.

* [Crt.sh](https://crt.sh) - Enter an Identity (Domain Name, Organization Name, etc), a Certificate Fingerprint (SHA-1 or SHA-256) or a crt.sh ID to return detailed domain and certificate information.
* [Google Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates) - A tool used to look up all of a domainâ€™s certificates that are present in [active public Certificate Transparency logs](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/known-logs)
* [https://sslmate.com/labs/ct\_policy\_analyzer/](https://sslmate.com/labs/ct\_policy\_analyzer/) - Certificate Transparency Policy Analyzer

### **Web Site Change Tracking**

Some times a target will change a website and you will want to be notified right away, usually to see what has changed and how you can exploit it.

* [Follow that page](https://followthatpage.com) - Follow That Page is a change detection and notification service that sends you an email when your favorite web pages have changed.
* [Visual Ping](https://visualping.io) - Tool that can track multiple different kinds of changes in a particular webpage and alert on specific conditions.
