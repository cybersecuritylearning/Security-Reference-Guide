## **People Search/PII**

This section will get stalker-ish real quick. While limited in usefulness for a penetration test, it can help you discover all the interesting data surrounding a person, or link data you have found back to an individual. For those who would like a premium all in one option, there are a few handy platforms that can make collection faster and easier.

<summary>Name Search</summary>

Name search records can get muddy really quickly when dealing with names like "John Smith", however many tools will allow you refine the search with other data points such as location or other context. As with any search tool, the more data you feed it, the more accurate your results will be. As always I like to start with one of Michael Bazzell's handy tools, **Name.html**. This tool will search databases of names that will return associated data points for building a full profile of your target. From here, the next step is to start looking for any public records that may be associated with the name you are searching for. Remember to use location to aid in context.
